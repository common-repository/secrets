Take out filters or actions with this plugin and eliminate the need for a functions.php file in your theme for it.

== Description ==

A simple and small plugin to enable or disable certain functions on Wordpress for which no default option exists. 
Take out filters or actions with this plugin and eliminate the need for a functions.php file in your theme for it. 

Since it makes no sense to add things to a front-end in order to make the back-end work better or differently.
Also don't you hate it that when you change themes you have to re-create the functions.php per theme with things you have long forgotten and don't want to think about? 

Secrets is for you then!
